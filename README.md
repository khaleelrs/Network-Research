This Bash script automates the installation and configuration of various security-related tools and services, focusing on anonymity and reconnaissance. The script checks for the installation of tools like Nipe, nmap, whois, geoip-bin, tor, sshpass, and jq. It also verifies if the current connection is anonymous, and if not, the script terminates. Additionally, the script establishes a remote connection to a specified server, retrieves information about the server, and performs whois and nmap scans on a specified domain or IP address. Logs are maintained in a "log.txt" file, and results from whois and nmap scans are saved in separate files for later analysis. The script is designed to enhance security measures and streamline reconnaissance tasks.
